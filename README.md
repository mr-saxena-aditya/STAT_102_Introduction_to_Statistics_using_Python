# Introduction to Statistics with Python Course

## Overview

This GitHub project hosts the curriculum and resources for the "Introduction to Statistics with Python" course, a comprehensive 4-week program designed and instructed by Aditya Saxena. This course aims to equip learners with a solid foundation in statistics while leveraging the power of Python for practical data analysis.

## Assessment and Final Project

- Weekly quizzes and assignments contribute to 40% of the final grade.
- The final project, where students apply statistical concepts and Python skills to analyze a real-world dataset, contributes to 30% of the final grade.
- Class participation is valued at 10%.
- The final exam is weighted at 20%.

## Prerequisites
